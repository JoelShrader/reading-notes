# Learning Markdown
[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a website that assists in the creation of webpages. Markdown is the programming language it uses, which is useful in generating HTML pages quickly and efficiently. It uses plain text with some symbols to alter the plain text into things like headers and lists and links. Github uses 'repositories' to do all this, which lets users share and store code. 

In the repository you can create markdown (.md) files. README.md is a basic one that displays information about the repository when you enter it. To get started you can use a number of online guides such as [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to learn the syntax. GitHub itself has helpful guides to get started such as [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
