# Operators and Loops
[Loops](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration) repeat an action some number of times. 

A `for` loop is as follows:

> `for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])`
> 
>   `statement`

where `initialExpression` is executed, `conditionExpression` is evaluated, and if `true` the `statement` part is executed. This repeats until evaluating `conditionExpression` returns false upon which the loop terminates.

A `while` loop is as follows:

> `while (condition)`
> 
>   `statement`

where `condition` is evaluated, and if `true`, `statement` is executed and `condition` is evaluated again. This repeats until there is a return of `false` for the `condition` evaluation.
