# About Me
My name is **Joel Shrader**. I have an Engineering Degree from [The University of Iowa College of Engineering](https://engineering.uiowa.edu/) in Environmental Engineering, as well as a certificate in Sustainability. Because I and some family are on the Autism Spectrum I have worked with several projects to help neurodiverse people gain assistance and accessibility, including helping author [A Voter's Guide to Iowa Elections](https://chsciowa.org/sites/chsciowa.org/files/resource/files/iowa_autism_voters_guide.pdf) and joining the [Corridor Autism Resource Expo](https://www.facebook.com/corridorautismresourceexpo), of which I am currently a board member. I enjoy strategy and role playing games in my free time, and assist in the care of an autistic family member.
