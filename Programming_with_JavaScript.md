# Programming with JavaScript
## Operators and Expressions
[Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators) are symbols that perform specific actions, such as `=` to set something as another thing or `==` to compare the values of two things. 

Expressions are valid units of code that resolve into a variable. 

> `x = 7`

is an expression with the operator `=`.

## Functions
[Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions) take input in some form and provide output. They must be 'declared', such as in the following format:

> `function functionName(parameter, parameter, etc) {`
> 
>   `JavaScript statement`
> 
> `}`

or you can use a function expression to do so inside an expression, such as:

> `const getRectArea = function(width, height) {`
> 
>  `return width * height;`
> 
> `};`
> 
> `console.log(getRectArea(3, 4));`

Note that variables defined inside the function are not accessible outside the function. 

## Control Flow
This is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. It is executed from first to last, except where told to change the flow such as with conditional statements and loops.
