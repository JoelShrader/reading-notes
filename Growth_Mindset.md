# Growth Mindset
Having a **Growth Mindset** is described as effectively believing that you can take whatever starting point you have with intelligence and talent and develop your abilities with the application of effort and perserverence, with the latter two being much more important factors in success. A **Fixed Mindset**, then, is described as believing that intelligence and talent alone are instead the determining factors of success. 

## Keeping up a Growth Mindset
1. Look at challenges as learning opportunities
2. Focus on the task at hand
3. Take helpful criticism and adapt
